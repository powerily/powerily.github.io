# General Guild Rules

DON’T BE A DICK!  

# Perc Rules

Each member will get one slot by default and have the ability to earn or buy additional slots. Members have the right to rent one additional slot at 50kk/week with the kamas going into the guild bank which funds guild events, misc guild chest items and rewards in the future. You can PM Rev or any SIC to rent a slot.

**Rewards**

We'll be using a scoring system on the people who defend via the Discord channel only, if it isn't posted there it won't be included. Every few weeks+- we'll be rewarding the top four defenders and their rewards will be:  

top defender: two extra slots  
runners-up: one extra slot  
  
If there’s a tie both members will get the reward.

Members can pick up a >200kk perc while the owner is offline to gain points towards extra slots. The top two collectors will receive one extra slot.   

Members can donate their rewarded slots to other players or to the guild for more chest items.    

Members may only have a maximum of 4 percs.  

# Paddocks

Three paddocks are available for member usage at [3,-33][-71,-36][-72,-37]. You may ask Rev for the rights and he'll give you them if he thinks you deserve them. Breeding items and mounts must be taken out of the paddock when finished. Active or fast breeding must be the only types of breeding done in the paddocks (serenity or no tiredness for example).  

# Recruitment Process

I welcome you all to ask if you can invite friends and providing no member has a reasonably high issue with them they should get in and bypass the trial process, we will, however, be watching them to make sure they fit with the vibe of the guild, but there will be no on trial process as outlined below:

If someone outside of close friends wants to join the guild council members will get a general feel of the person and decide if we should press forward to the trial process, the trial will last 1-2 weeks depending on how definitive we believe the member vote will be. If they pass that period without firm dislike from council members we'll have a guild vote and talk about the members on a channel only visible to members of the guild and delete the messages after. If no one has a serious issue with the person they'll be upgraded to member status.

I'm aware that we're a small guild, but I very much believe in quality over quantity. I'm happy with the overall guild vibe and I would like to keep it friendly and an easy, open recruitment process would open the floodgates to having problematic members, a trial/close friend/vouch process mitigates this issue almost completely. I don’t care about level, but of course it’s nice to have good players, I much prefer the general vibe of the player.

# Member Issues

If anyone has an issue with another member, no matter their rank you can pm Rev to discuss your concerns and if I believe they’re legitimate I’ll talk to the member privately, this will be a completely anonymous process unless explicitly asked or the situation is so personal it doesn’t allow anonymity and consent is given.

If there’s a fight within the guild the council will talk and decide the most just action, both members need to take it to PM when warned or face being kicked. I understand that sometimes people get emotional or are having a bad day etc and I won’t judge you for it but if you continue after clear-headed people ask you to stop I’ll have to take action and If it becomes a recurring thing you’ll be kicked.

These rules aren’t ironclad because when it comes to these things sometimes static rules are ineffective and the situation must be judged on case by case basis to an extent. I can promise that I and the council members will do our very best to remove possible bias while making these decisions. I definitely have my favourite members, some people I’ve known for almost a decade, but I’ll tell anyone to tone it down, even if we’re very close in private to avoid making a scene/embarrassing the person.   

Lastly no one's perfect and I’m surely not so try to let the small things go and don’t hold grudges against people as it makes life much more enjoyable.
