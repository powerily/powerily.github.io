**General Guild Rules**

DON’T BE A DICK!    
5% experience donation is appreciated but not mandatory

**Perc Rules**

Each member will get one perc slot by default and have the ability to earn or buy additional slots. Members have the right to rent ONE additional slot at 100kk/week with the kamas going into the guild bank which funds guild events, misc guild chest items and rewards in the future. You can PM Rev or any SIC to rent a slot.

**Perc Defence Rewards**

We'll be using a scoring system on the people who defend percs via the Discord channel only, if it isn't screened and posted there it won't be included. Every couple weeks+- we'll be announcing the top three perc defenders and their rewards will be:

top defender: two extra perc slots  
runners up: one extra perc slot  
If there’s a tie both members will get the reward.

**Recruitment Process**

I welcome you all to ask if you can invite friends and providing no member has a reasonably high issue with them they should get in and bypass the trial process, we will, however, be watching them to make sure they fit with the vibe of the guild but there will be no on trial process as outlined below:

If someone outside of close friends wants to join the guild council members will get a general feel of the person and decide if we should press forward to the trial process, the trial will last 1-2 weeks depending on how definitive we believe the member vote will be. If they pass that period without firm dislike from council members we'll have a guild vote and talk about the members on a channel only visible to members of the guild and possibly delete the messages after. If no one has a serious issue with the person they'll be upgraded to member status. I will be reprimanding people if they abuse the invite system and vote no for every candidate (providing a very high majority of other members like them) however.

I'm aware that we're a small guild but I very much believe in quality over quantity. I'm happy with the overall guild vibe and I would like to keep it friendly and an easy, open recruitment process would open the floodgates to having problematic members, a trial/close friend/vouch process mitigates this issue almost completely. I don’t care about level but of course it’s nice to have good players, I much prefer the general vibe of the player.

**Member Issues**

If anyone has an issue with another member no matter their rank you can pm Rev to discuss your concerns and if I believe they’re legitimate I’ll talk to the member privately, this will be a completely anonymous process unless explicitly asked or the situation is so personal it doesn’t allow anonymity. I will not tolerate problematic members.

If there’s a fight within the guild the council will talk and decided the most just action, both members need to take it to PM when warned or face being kicked. I understand that sometimes people get emotional or are having a bad day etc and I won’t judge you for it but if you continue after clear headed people ask you to stop I’ll have to take action and If it becomes a recurring thing you’ll be kicked.

These rules aren’t ironclad because when it comes to these things sometimes static rules are ineffective and the situation must be judged on case by case basis to an extent. I can promise that I and the council members will do our very best to remove possible bias while making these decisions. I definitely have my favourite members, some people I’ve known for almost a decade, but I’ll tell ANYONE to tone it down, even if we’re very close in private to avoid making a scene/embarrassing the person. I’ve had to do that twice so far.

Lastly no one's perfect and I’m surely not so try to let the small things go and don’t hold grudges against people as it makes life much more enjoyable.
